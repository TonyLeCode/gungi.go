# WIP
Since the community for this game is small, being able to play correspondence seems to be the best idea to get games. I was inspired by Gungi.io by Jwyce's site and decided to make my own.

# Gungi.go
Webapp to play Gungi from Hunter x Hunter.
Allows for live and correspondence games as well as a couple of different rules.

## How to setup
Create two `.env` files. One in client and one in server.
Client: 
```
PORT=
API=
```

Server: 
```
CORS_ORIGIN=
PORT=
```
