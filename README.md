##  Gungi
This is a webapp that allows you to play Gungi from Hunter x Hunter.
Allows for live and correspondence games as well as a few different rules.

I was inspired by Jwyce's [site](https://github.com/jwyce/gungi.io), Gungi.io, and decided to make my own with additional features.

Since the community for this game is small, I figured correspondence would be a good way to get people to play.

Games will be saved in a database and users will be able to replay a game's history.

## Road Map
The initial release will have the revised community rules. The Universal Music rules will be included at a later time. I also plan to experiment and iterate on the revised community rules in the future.

I also plan to add an AI so that players may practice if no one is online to play a live match.

I'd also like to include localization so players in other countries can play as well.
